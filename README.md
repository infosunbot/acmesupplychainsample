# acmesupplychainsample


 The challenge was done with Solidity. My home computer is not configured for Solidity development. For this reason, I used the remix web compiler. https://remix.ethereum.org/
Itâ€™s a powerful tool and provide unit testing feature. Contract functions can call within unit test file: AcmeSupplyChain_test.sol
